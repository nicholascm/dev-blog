## Go Sync or Async, but avoid the in-between

Back before remote work came into vogue after 2020, you had a couple of different kinds of remote workers. There were the remote people who worked with a team where they were the only remote person (common for companies to offer when a person needed to relocate but wanted to keep their job), and then the fully remote teams that had always been remote.

Very often, the fully remote companies who were always remote had an idea about remote. They went remote because they wanted to live where they wanted to live, but also because they placed a high value on being able to engage in deep work. These companies (such as Basecamp, Gitlab, Trello, Doist) further extolled the values of a truly asyncronous culture. In these cultures, person to person "messaging" would be placed at a lower importance than tools designed for async communications, e.g. shared documentation and commenting tools, shared notes, long form posts with replies. In a sense, because of their global distribution, team members could never assume that anyone was available to discuss what they wanted to "right now", but instead, needed to rely on communicating that information in such a way as it could be consumed at people's availability, later on, without them being present. The payoff, being that globally distributed teams could be on the same page without working the same hours, while people were free to organize their time and day structure in the way that best suited them.

Fast forward to 2020 and beyond, and many companies have adopted remote work, but often times the work communication culture is nothing like what has been described above.

Many of these new "remote companies" were not quite the enthusiasts of remote work of their predecessors because they were either forced to go remote during 2020 and never came back, or they just simply didn't put the time into thinking about how communication "should" best be done given the new work environment. The transition was essentially to allow people to start working from home, but still rely on most of the same tools as when people were in office, MS Teams / Slack style messaging systems, Zoom calls and scheduled meetings regularly being the norm among most to adopt this strategy.

This transition lends itself to a few problems. Whereas in office, many important communications where happening ad-hoc, quickly, in conversation, now nearly every conversation will face the barrier of creating a meeting or making a call, which experience tells us people are somewhat reluctant to do. They may fall back on either trying to discuss something over chat which would be much more readily and speedily solved with the additional context cues of a conversation, or they will invite more people than necessary to a longer meeting than is necessary (to avoid not including someone) and further complicate the issue or make getting to a solution more challenging. 7 people to discuss something 3 people could have solved is both a higher cost and higher friction solution to a problem.

To top all of this off, these remote teams often suffer for lack of connection. Without emphasis being placed on person to person relationships, many will not maintain the office friendships that were maintained organically by working in the same location, eating, walking in, standing in the elevator with, their peers. These relationships will deteriorate over time, which increases employee burnout, depression, and fosters a lack of connection with the company as a whole.

So what can be done?

Well, to continue with the last point, a greater emphasis must be placed on peer to peer non-work related conversations. Team members and managers must take it upon themselves to provide the space to take back time for conversing about non-work related things, as they would have done in an office environment. It could mean dropping 5-10 minute meetings on the calendar with peers to ensure that there is regular time for this set aside. Encouragement from leadership helps here, but even in that absence, team members should take it upon themselves to reach out to other team members, but leadership certainly must be approving of the time investment here. New tooling has emerged in the past year or so that aims to bring back "ad hoc" communications, such as the stealth startup "Roam Virtual HQ." These types of tools may help teams get back to the office feeling that they once had by changing the paradigm of communication back to something office-like. Companies where most employees are working the same hours and prefer a syncronous style of communication would do well to investigate such types of tooling at the very least.

In the absence of the above changes, then teams should consider the tools of the remote teams of old - the async-first communications. New-ish tools such as Miro and Figma offer excellent ways of async communicating via diagrams and designs, with well-built commenting and feedback tools in addition to their live-editing tools. Furthermore, other documentation tools e.g. Confluence, Notion, etc. can help teams to stay on the same page and facilitate some of the async culture and feedback that is needed to bring down the number of oversized meeting while still allowing people who want to contribute to contribute as necessary. Offloading from chat into these types of tools ultimately allows people to be a little bit freer from slavery to the Notification Bubble which can be distracting and overburden remote team members who were used to in-person syncronous communications like someone tapping on their shoulder.


Solution
- either invest heavily in p2p time over the phone - encourage it, live it OR
- invest heavily in async comms, enforce it, get the right tools, and do it that way
- don't choose nothing.
